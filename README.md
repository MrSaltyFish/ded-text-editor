### OpenGL

opengl - graphics api used by all of the three below
glfw - simply an opengl initializer
sd12 - a little bit more than just an opengl initializer
raylib - full blown gamedev library and almost a game engine
==============
SDL2 is a cross-platform low-level graphics library with its own logging system
