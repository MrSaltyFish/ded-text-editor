hi this is normal 5 unit camera speed
this is 6x the speed hopefully
Nvm it was same
This will be faster 
This is now 10x faster than before and it is already snappy
IT IS TOO FAST AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Now this is 5x the base speed
Now it is 3x the speed
This is AAAAAAAAAAAAA not reducing what?
No it was increasing
Now it is smooth and slow with everything interpolating
This is because it is 5 units, the base
Now it will stay here. See, it is in place
Now if I return it to normal speed then it
will fix itself right back.
